## Project Description
This project is a console-based People Management System built in Java.  
It demonstrates advanced Java OOP concepts such as abstraction, inheritance, interfaces, polymorphism, recursion, exception handling, and file I/O.  
The system allows adding, listing, searching, removing people (Students, Professors, Teaching Assistants) and evaluating their performance.

## Features
- Abstract class `Person`
- Subclasses: `Student`, `Professor`, `TeachingAssistant`
- Interface `Evaluable`
- Menu-driven console interface
- Input validation & exception handling
- Recursion methods
- File persistence for saving/loading data
- Search by ID or Name (method overloading)
